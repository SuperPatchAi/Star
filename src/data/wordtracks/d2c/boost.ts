  overview: `Boost is your daily dose of natural, sustained energy without the jitters, crash, or sugar of traditional stimulants. Designed for anyone seeking an effective and healthy way to combat fatigue, improve focus, and maintain vitality throughout their day, Boost delivers clean energy to help you perform at your best, naturally.

What makes Boost truly unique is its foundation in Super Patch's proprietary Vibrotactile Technology (VTT). Unlike supplements you ingest or topical creams, Boost uses specialized ridge patterns embedded in the patch that interact with your skin's mechanoreceptors. This interaction triggers your body's own neural responses, signaling for increased natural energy production. It's 100% drug-free, all-natural, and non-invasive, offering a revolutionary approach to sustained vitality.`,

  productPresentation: {
    problem: `Have you ever found yourself hitting that dreaded afternoon slump, feeling like you need another coffee or an energy drink just to push through? Or maybe you're tired of the jitters and the inevitable crash that comes with those quick fixes? It's a common struggle – trying to keep up with life's demands while feeling constantly drained, often relying on stimulants that eventually leave you feeling worse.`,
    
    agitate: `This isn't just about feeling a bit tired; it impacts everything. Your focus at work slips, your patience with family wears thin, and you might even skip workouts or social plans because you just don't have the energy. And those stimulants? While they offer a temporary boost, they can disrupt your sleep, mess with your digestion, and create a cycle of dependency that's hard to break, ultimately hindering your long-term health and vitality.`,
    
    solve: `That's why I'm so excited about the Super Patch Boost. Imagine getting clean, sustained energy all day long, without any sugar, caffeine, or stimulants. Boost uses revolutionary Vibrotactile Technology – it's a small patch with special patterns that simply touch your skin. These patterns communicate with your body's natural systems, helping it optimize its own neural responses to produce and sustain energy naturally. No pills, no drinks, no crash. Just consistent, natural vitality so you can power through your day, stay focused, and feel your best from morning to night. It's a completely drug-free, non-invasive way to unlock your body's own energy potential.`
