  productPresentation: `<p><strong>[Problem]</strong> "We all know how frustrating it can be to try and break a bad habit. You set a goal, you're motivated, but then those intense cravings hit, or stress builds up, and suddenly, you're right back where you started. It feels like a constant battle against your own willpower, doesn't it? And every time you try and fail, it chips away at your confidence."</p>

<p><strong>[Agitate]</strong> "Think about the cycle: the guilt, the disappointment, the health consequences, the money spent on things you're trying to quit. It's exhausting, and it makes you question if you'll ever truly gain control. Many people feel like they're just not strong enough, or that they're destined to struggle with these patterns forever. It's not just about the habit itself, it's about the feeling of losing control over your own choices."</p>

<p><strong>[Solve]</strong> "That's exactly why I'm so excited about the Super Patch <strong>Kick It</strong>. Imagine having natural, consistent support for your willpower, without any drugs or invasive procedures. Kick It uses groundbreaking Vibrotactile Technology – specialized patterns on a small patch that communicate with your body's nervous system, triggering your own natural responses to enhance self-control and reduce cravings. It's 100% drug-free, all-natural, and incredibly simple to use. With Kick It, you're not fighting a battle alone; you're empowering your body to naturally support your journey to break free from habits like smoking, overeating, or anything else holding you back."</p>`,
