  productPresentation: `<p><strong>[Problem]</strong> "It sounds like you're really looking for a way to consistently feel more positive and manage daily stress better. Many people I speak with feel the same way. In today's fast-paced world, it's incredibly common to feel overwhelmed, stressed, or just a bit 'off' emotionally. We're constantly bombarded, and it can be really tough to maintain that sense of inner calm and a positive outlook."</p>

<p><strong>[Agitate]</strong> "And when our mood dips, it doesn't just affect us; it spills over into our relationships, our work, and our ability to enjoy the simple things in life. It can leave us feeling drained, unmotivated, and searching for answers, often leading to temporary fixes that don't truly address the root cause, or even come with unwanted side effects."</p>

<p><strong>[Solve]</strong> "That's exactly why I'm so excited about the <strong>Super Patch Joy</strong>. Imagine a natural, drug-free, and incredibly simple way to tap into your body's own ability to feel happier and more balanced. The Joy patch uses something called Vibrotactile Technology – it's a specialized pattern on the patch that interacts with your skin, sending a signal to your brain to naturally enhance your mood, promote emotional well-being, and give you a more positive outlook. You just place it on your skin, and it works with your body, not against it. It's truly a game-changer for anyone wanting to reclaim their emotional peace and joy, without any chemicals or invasiveness."</p>`,
